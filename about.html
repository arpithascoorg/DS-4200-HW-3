        <h1>Favorite Travel Destinations</h1>
        <p>Traveling around the world has allowed me to visit some of the most incredible places. 
            Each destination has its own charm, beauty, and rich history. Although everyone I 
            travelled to has been memorable, the following destinations have been my favorite.
            Paris France, Agra India, and Athens Greece. These locations are known for their breathtaking
            architecture, historical importance, and vibrant cultures.

                    <h2>Paris, France:</h2>
                    <p>The city of art, fashion, and history. Walking through the streets of Paris, 
                        visiting popular landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Lourve Museum, and experiencing 
                        the French cuisine was unforgettable. The cities atmosphere, filled with charming cafes and

                    <h2>Agra, India:</h2>
                    <p>The Taj Mahal in India is one of the most beautiful monuments I have ever seen. 
                        This stunning white marble mausoleum represents love and dedication. Seeing it up close, 
                        especially at sunrise was an unforgettable experience. The detailed carvings and important 
                        details added to its beauty. </p>

                    <h2>Athens, Greece:</h2>
                    <p>Exploring the ruins of the Parthenon and the Acropolis gave me a glimpse into 
                        Greek history and mythology. The city is a perfect example of blending the past and the present 
                        to make something beautiful. With the historic sites standing alongside modern streets, making 
                        this desitination one of the best. </p>
