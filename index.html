        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>Hi, My name is Arpitha Coorg! I am a second year Data Science Major at Northeastern University.
            I am passionate about traveling! Seeing new places all over the world and learning about new cultures 
            has always interested me. Traveling gives me the opportunity to experience unique traditions, 
            exploring historical landmarks and trying delicious different cuisines. I enjoy planning trips,
            creating detailed itineraries, and capturing my destinations through photography. Whether its a big city,
            quiet small town, or somewhere more rural, every trip has added to my understanding of the world. Each place I
            visit provides new experiences, perspectives, and insights into different ways of life. 
            Through my past and future travels, I hope to continue broaden my perspective of the world and 
            deepening my appreciation for different cultures and ways of life. One of the things I enjoy 
            most about traveling is the ability to meet new people and hear their stories. Every destination 
            has a unique charm and appeal that makes it extremely special. From exploring ancient buildings 
            and hiking in national parks, I find joy in discovering both well-known landmarks and hidden gems. 
            On this website, I share some of my favorite destinations and the beautiful things I saw. 
        </p>
